App to help people to get know if they were in touch with an infected person

This is an open-source project.
Please take it, change it, use it as you like.
We build this project to help people get to know if there were in touch with infected people.
We encourage people in the world not to wait for government to build the app for them but use what we build and adopt to their country and API of infected persons.

The application collects location in background and matches it with data from the Israeli Ministry of health. (you can easily switch it to different API)
Also, it uses chrome to download location history from Google API, later it parses those downloaded files from the "Download folder" and add it to the map.
Data stored locally in SQLite and nothing is sent to any server. (We wanted to build API with Ministry of Health but stop due to lack of collaboration)
